selection bias to be sure, but the number (>1) of hospital staff encountered in the various baby-related departments (pcea/recovery, Mother / Baby, pedes' offices) with transexual-related stickers/paraphernalia on their ID/security badges was troubling. Chotchkie flair as ever: no change in speech or tells, so no real cause for worry. an acute illness.

My wife and I recently welcomed our first child to the world, and neither of us were really prepared for just how many diapers an infant can go through. I can change a diaper in under a minute, but my wife, a wheelchair user, faces some unique challenges w/r/t this task. Specifically, she gets along much better when things are roll-under. Our kitchen table is the perfect height, so I based the height off of that.

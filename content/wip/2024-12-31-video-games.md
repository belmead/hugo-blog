I don't at which age I began to game — between six and eight years of age, I reckon — and so I've been at this hobby for at least 75% of my life. I anticipate this number will only increase as I age. Were I a smarter man, I would have compiled a list sooner and kept up with it, but alas, I've always been a poor planner.

I'm keeping this a list of games I've spent at least ~15 minutes with and/or more than two credits' worth.

## The Games I've Played

**Kirby's Adventure — NES**
One of the original games that just appeared in my house one day, along with an NES. I think I remember getting it new, but many of my games were from pawn shops, so I'll never know. I loved the soundtrack then and now, and prided myself on a hitless run.

**Super Mario Bros. — NES**
Another game that just appeared from nowhere. Definitely not new when purchased. My dad and I used to love going to pawn shops on weekends, and there was always a copy of SMB available.

**Super Mario Bros. 2. — NES**
Never felt like a sequel to SMB, and at the time (early 90s) I wasn't aware of the game's history. I did enjoy being able to play as Luigi and Peach. I thought her ability to float was OP.

**Super Mario Bros. 3 — NES**
I played this more than any of the previous 2 SMB titles. I was blown away by the abilities of the tanooki suit, the shoe, and the hammer suit. Giant Land was amazing to me as a child, as sprites of that size were uncommon in the games I played.

**Top Gun — NES**
I did not enjoy this game at the time and have never played it since. I suspect not having the manual hurt my ability to understand the gameplay.

**Amagon — NES**
I definitely remember getting this from a pawn shop. I found it difficult and never got too far. I played it again as an adult and got farther than I ever did as a child, but it still wasn't that fun.

**Faxanadu — NES**
Rented this a lot from Video One. Was too dumb as a kid to appreciate it. 

**Yo! Noid — NES**
Rented this often from Blockbuster Video. I never saw the commercials, so I didn't understand the mascot, but it was a fun platformer.

**Marble Madness — NES**
Thought the isometric view was interesting, but made for a frustrating play. I recall being annoyed with the controls.

**Bubble Bobble — NES**
I loved this game. Very satisfying to chain attacks on enemies.

**Ice Climbers — NES**
I did not enjoy this game too much.

**Gauntlet — NES**
Loved this game.

Mega Man 1 - 6

**Galaga — Arcade**
I distinctly recall hurting my wrist playing this at Jolly Time in the Odessa Mall (before the mall was renamed and the arcade moved to make way for the theater). Dad said it was carpal tunnel, and I now know that was a correct diagnosis.

**Hard Drivin' — Arcade**
Even back then I thought the graphics were poor. Unenjoyable, but interesting as a novelty.

**Virtua Fighter — Arcade**
I was never good at "realistic" fighting games.

**Marvel vs. Capcom — Arcade**
One of my all-time favorite games. I could never do amazing combos, but could — more often than now — beat the game on a single credit with Ryu and Wolverine. I entered into a tournament at the arcade and did not place in the top 5 — I think every other player was at least twice my age — but I do remember dad telling me he was proud that I entered anyway. 

**Street Fighter vs. Marvel — Arcade**
I loved these crossover games. Beautiful sprite work.

**Mortal Kombat — Arcade**

**Mortal Kombat 2 — Arcade**

**Mortal Kombat 3 — Arcade**

**Police Trainer — Arcade**

**Area 51 — Arcade**

**Golden Axe — Arcade**
Played this often at the laundromat my dad and I frequented. I don't remember which character I liked to go with.

**Steet Fighter II — Arcade**
Played this often at the (other) laundromat my dad and I frequented.

**Super Street Fighter III Alpha (?)**
I didn't "get" this game despite how many quarters I fed it over the years at Jolly Time. Or was it Wal-Mart?

**Aliens — Arcade**
I didn't play it much, but I loved the art direction. I saw *Alien* when I way too young and thought the arcade game did a fine job of capturing the feel of the movie.

Simpsons

X-Men

X-Men: Children of the Atom

That AVP beat em up

**Primal Rage — Arcade**
It was available, so I played it. Not much to say.

**The Avengers — Arcade**
Played this one quite a few times — I opted for Vision, I think. Not bad. I remember thinking the game went on forever.

**Cruisin' USA — Arcade**
Similar story to Primal Rage — it was there, so I played it. Better than a claw game. I don't enjoy racing games.

**Killer Instinct — Arcade**
I played KI2 before this one, so it never really did it for me. I do appreciate how the series started, however.

**Killer Instinct 2 — Arcade**
Played this almost as much as the crossover fighting games. Could reliably beat the game on a single credit with Glacius (the gray color variant). The music and sound effects were sublime and the announcer still plays in my head from time to time.

**Gauntlet — Arcade**
I really enjoyed this game, but thought the interface was a bit too much. It was difficult to pay attention to what was important on screen.

**House of the Dead — Arcade**
Probably the last lightgun game I played. It was okay.

**Donkey Kong — Arcade**
Played it for the novelty.

**Burger Time — Arcade**
Cool idea. Boring after a few rounds.

**Ninja Gaiden — Arcade**
For whatever reason, a Long John Silvers in my hometown had this game. I was too young to play it well, but enjoyed it.

**Pinball — Arcade**
Lots of pinball games. Can't tell you which ones.

Dig Dug — Arcade
Available at a bowling alley in Odessa. I thought it was rude to blow up monsters.

Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance — PS4
I cannot recall why I downloaded this, but I was reading Gematsu at the time, so surely the two are connected. I really liked the art style (HD sprites!) and though my misplaying of Final Fantasy Tactics left a bad taste in my mouth for tactical RPGs, I gave it a go (it was probably on sale on the Playstation Store). Despite being more intricate than Tactics, it was easy enough to understand after a few play sessions, and I reckon I put 80 - 100 hours into it. Very, very good, despite a B- story. 

Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny — PS4
I barely beat this one. I was dismayed by the switch to polygons, but I've softened on that front since it came out. The story was not interesting at all, and to this day I do not understand / appreciate the infatuation with sibling relationships in many Japanese games. Also annoying was the auto battling system. The inclusion of this idle-gaming feature baffles me to this day.

PC Games
Include steam list here. I don't think Spiral Knights shows up anymore. Or Day of Defeat. JezzBall, all those games on the windows entertainment disk. Blast Thru was the brickout game. Those games by Cactus. Asia 88 or something? Worms. UT, UT2001, etc. Halo. The incredible machine, diablo II, rise of the triad, blood, blood 2,

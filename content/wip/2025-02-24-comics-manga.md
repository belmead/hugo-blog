### Barnes and Noble

I don't particularly care for Barens & Noble these days. Twenty years ago, my friends and I would drive to Midland, TX to hang out (Midland simply had more interesting retail stores to go to — Best Buy, B&N, plus a handful of premium mediocre restaurants) on Saturday evenings. B&N was (still is) in the same shopping strip as Best Buy (off Loop 250) and for three (often four) 16- and 17-year-olds who didn't drink or smoke and shot the breeze about Photoshop and whether or not it was the right time to jump ship to 64-bit processors, those two spots were right up our collective alleys. Know this was circa 2002, only a bit before Amazon became a household name, and ages prior to Prime memberships. If my memory serves, there was a rack of manga/comics back then, but it was only one section wide. End caps and standalone displays did have the newest hardbacks — the top-five NYT Best Seller's list — but stockists more often than not stacked classics and _ than the hits of pop lit. The display coordinated with the consumer miliue: Any given Saturday evening was spent alongside the elderly and those nearing that cohort. It was a rare sight indeed to see someone in our age bracket.

Quite a turnabout now, I've noticed: Now I'm the old man at the B&N (not even 40 yet!), and the number of... unattended adolescents born and raised of circumstance, with nary an undyed strand of hair to be seen, milling about the aggressively degen manga titles would be alarming were it not for . I'm unsure if there are more ambiguous characters on the covers or in the aisles. 

Businesses exist to make money, and that B&N is still around is a study in reslilience in and of itself, so they stock what sells, natch. It is clear, however, that there is very little in the way of comics or manga for men. Or any other non-graphic work, for that matter. I spent most of my undergraduate years in liberal arts buildings, and that's how it is at the B&N. Angry people buying angry books by angry authors, checked out by angry employees. There were but few men at the book seller this past weekend, and they were dragged along. Their attire informed me they do not read.

Of course, comics are for fools and dupes, and I am chief among that lot. There's no new story under the sun, nor a fresh species of conflict. C'est très amusant que unhappy families are unique, and the tropes and times do vary, greatly at times, but  psychology doesn't change across time, at least not appreciably. It's all the same stuff, with different tropes and in different periods. Modern twists, they call it, but it's the same old fears and ambition. Marvel and DC heartily embrace the paradox of genre — to quote Annalee Newitz (over at [The Hypothesis](https://buttondown.com/thehypothesis/archive/how-much-are-you-willing-to-pay-for-a-fantasy/))

>By definition, fans of genre consume very similar pieces of content repeatedly. Radway calls this the “paradox” of genre. Each story needs to feel different, without ever diverging from the basic formula. Together, the stories within a genre create a kind of alternate world that audiences can return to with each new piece of content. The more genre fiction they find, the more time they can spend in that world.

This is why Superman doesn't die, or only but temporarily, maybe for a run or two. Growth or meaningful change is anathema to a story that, for most of its history, has sold well.

---- better start: ----

The best thing about the original (UK) version of The Office is that *it ended*. That is, it was written with an end in mind rather than having finality forced upon it. Two series (seasons, each six episodes long) and a Christmas special later, the show concluded and the actors and staff moved on to other projects. The US version, for reference, had six episodes in its first season (not an uncommon number) and 22 episodes in season two. All in all, there were 201 episodes of the US version spanning across 38 DVDs. To be fair, I enjoyed the US version more (up till Steve Carrell left the show), but the UK version had a sense of finality that the US version never had. The Office (US) is a perfect example of how many television shows are treated here in the States: Capitalize on a popular show by keeping it alive well after its prime and ending it far too late.

*From Reddit user richk7074 ([/r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/66awqa/the_office_ratings_and_viewership_oc/))*

It is of note that while viewership decreased, the average rating per episode stayed more or less in the same band, which is not an easy feat to accomplish, especially after the main star of the show left. Excellent — or even passable — writing can't save a show whose audience has moved on, it seems.

The Office (either version) is a self-contained entity. If you want to watch it, just start at S1E1. The same can be said for manga, for the most part: If you want to read Akira, just buy issue (or collection) #1. Some series do have spin-offs, but most do do not, and you miss nothing by reading a mainline entry and leaving it at that. Furthermore, manga is self-contained, so one needn't pick up any unrelated titles out of fear of missing a plot point or reference later on. Western comics, however, are designed with a markedly different, nearly opposite tactic: Interrelated plot points scattered across runs.

On the whole, western popular media is immature. Finality is the cornerstone of storytelling, and money lies in building, not shipping. This is in line with Annalee Newitz's paradox of genre (over at [The Hypothesis](https://buttondown.com/thehypothesis/archive/how-much-are-you-willing-to-pay-for-a-fantasy/))

I posit the paradox extends upward to encompass the medium. Shall it be said consumers are at fault for there being more than 100 runs of Spiderman and variations thereof? Partially, as they are the demand part of the equation. But demand is shaped by suppliers, too, and Marvel (as synechdoche) knows this. It is true that sales are down for western comics (comic shops are ghost towns, which is why so many of them now sell cards as well) despite MCU films, on average, doing big numbers. Forgot what my point is here.

## Never Learn, Never Change

Superheroes (I'm using that perjoratively, here, for western comics) never change — they can't, in fact — as that prevents . If the reader does not change, the characters mustn't, either, so they reinforce each other. On the other hand, when (more like 'if') the user does change, the publsher loses a customer. What's more, it reinforces the normalization of stagnation, which may be in some way partly responsible for the perpetual twighlight of youth.

## Prioritization of Familiarity over Growth

Despite any implicit character growth, it matters not if there's demonstrably no alteration. Relying on this idea — implicit vs. explicit growth — bifurcates characters into "head canon" and what's actually on the page. That is to say, it's but fan fiction. New readers and readers who don't have the trait of forming their own internal canons of who a character is based on a hundred runs are destined to eventually move on when they themselves change and no longer care to reread the same stories ad infinitum. 

## Cui Bono?

In the 90s, many churches turned to what we refer to now as the "seeker sentitivity movement" in order to get more congregants into pews. Bad pastors decided that the Truth wasn't exciting enough, so they embraced silly, secular nonsense (modern worship music, hip sermons, reader response exegesis) to draw a crowd. The problem that arose was that, as it turns out, whatever you use to attract people with, you need to keep supplying it, and oftentimes you'll need to ratchet it up across time to maintain  numbers. This is why deaths are cheap and stakes mean nothing — just reboot the hero, start a new run. No one ever really dies.

Who benefits? Only the publishers, it seems. Fans are just as well served with a Spiderman story from the 80s as they would be with one from the 90s, 2000s, 10s, or now. He's always the same, maybe a change of color, but always the same. This preserves brand recognition, certainly, but at what cost? Mature readers can understand the tactics involved, but a younger reader's takeaways may be harmful to their own growth. 

## Hermetic Tales

The near-opposite is true for manga: The outliers are stories like JoJo's Bizaare Adventure, and DBZ, which seemingly go on forever. Vastly more common are self-contained stories that go on for a dozen or two books and then stop. Akira is an excellent example of this: There's no other Akira story but Akira. There's the classic '88 film, a couple of video games, but that's it. It can rest peacefully in place and be enjoyed by subsequent generations. This is what the finest pieces of work are able to do: Stand alone. Dostoyevsky didn't need to write Crime and Punishment II or The Idiot: The Prequel.

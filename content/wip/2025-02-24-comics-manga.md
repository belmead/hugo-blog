### Barnes and Noble

I don't particularly care for Barens & Noble these days. Twenty years ago, my friends and I would drive to Midland, TX to hang out (Midland simply had more interesting retail stores to go to — Best Buy, B&N, plus a handful of premium mediocre restaurants) on Saturday evenings. B&N was (still is) in the same shopping strip as Best Buy (off Loop 250) and for three (often four) 16- and 17-year-olds who didn't drink or smoke and shot the breeze about Photoshop and whether or not it was the right time to jump ship to 64-bit processors, those two spots were right up our collective alleys. Know this was circa 2002, only a bit before Amazon became a household name, and ages prior to Prime memberships. If my memory serves, there was a rack of manga/comics back then, but it was only one section wide. End caps and standalone displays did have the newest hardbacks — the top-five NYT Best Seller's list — but stockists more often than not stacked classics and _ than the hits of pop lit. The display coordinated with the consumer miliue: Any given Saturday evening was spent alongside the elderly and those nearing that cohort. It was a rare sight indeed to see someone in our age bracket.

Quite a turnabout now, I've noticed: Now I'm the old man at the B&N (not even 40 yet!), and the number of... unattended adolescents born and raised of circumstance, with nary an undyed strand of hair to be seen, milling about the aggressively degen manga titles would be alarming were it not for . I'm unsure if there are more ambiguous characters on the covers or in the aisles. 

Businesses exist to make money, and that B&N is still around is a study in reslilience in and of itself, so they stock what sells, natch. It is clear, however, that there is very little in the way of comics or manga for men. Or any other non-graphic work, for that matter. I spent most of my undergraduate years in liberal arts buildings, and that's how it is at the B&N. Angry people buying angry books by angry authors, checked out by angry employees. There were but few men at the book seller this past weekend, and they were dragged along. Their attire informed me they do not read.

Of course, comics are for fools and dupes, and I am chief among that lot. There's no new story under the sun, nor a fresh species of conflict. C'est très amusant que unhappy families are unique, and the tropes and times do vary, greatly at times, but  psychology doesn't change across time, at least not appreciably. It's all the same stuff, with different tropes and in different periods. Modern twists, they call it, but it's the same old fears and ambition. Marvel and DC heartily embrace the paradox of genre — to quote Annalee Newitz (over at [The Hypothesis](https://buttondown.com/thehypothesis/archive/how-much-are-you-willing-to-pay-for-a-fantasy/))

>By definition, fans of genre consume very similar pieces of content repeatedly. Radway calls this the “paradox” of genre. Each story needs to feel different, without ever diverging from the basic formula. Together, the stories within a genre create a kind of alternate world that audiences can return to with each new piece of content. The more genre fiction they find, the more time they can spend in that world.

This is why Superman doesn't die, or only but temporarily, maybe for a run or two. Growth or meaningful change is anathema to a story that, for most of its history, has sold well.

A while ago, I explained the meme pipeline to an intern (slow day). A reductive version of it goes something like this:

{{< callout type="tip" text="4chan -> YouTube/Reddit -> Facebook" >}}

The arrows are not to temporal scale: An idea can bounce around on 4chan for years ('normies,' 'chads') prior escaping to YouTube and Reddit, before finally coming to rest at Facebook. En—tification is the latest 

this might be a good intro: In compiling the list of wisdom my father gave me (link to other post here), a few things have made themselves known:
1. I dramatically overassume on others' knowledge.
2. my father, a plain man - indeed, a redneck from east Texas - passed on to me wisdom less noticed in others as time goes on
3. the desire to know, or the hatred of not knowing, is a quality rarer than I estimated.

YouTube is a funny reflection: Show me a man's homepage and I'll tell you his interests. it has a fun house aspect to it, a heavy handedness that assumes you've a great interest in residential electrics if you watch a single video about changing a doorbell transformer, but it's accurate in a vulgar sort of way.

there's a meta showing up in my homepage lately, what I'm terming 'PCL' — problem-cause-lament. here's the m.o.:

- identify the predictable
- experience the predictable
- feign bafflement or disappointment
- anodyne conclusion

(collection of yt screenshots here)

'tactical oblivion' is, I believe, an attempt at playing nice: the alternative, e.g., not knowing marketing exists to deceive and manipulate, seems worse. that is, I'm peeved less by the actor than the truly ignorant, which is a curious attitude to have. I don't feel great about that. bit of a thinker, that.

And this was from Gemini, re: https://asteriskmag.com/issues/11/scapegoating-the-algorithm I added to it as well
You've perfectly articulated a common and frustrating pattern in a certain type of commentary, labeling it "midwittery." It's a critique of articles that follow a superficial "problem-cause-lament" structure without offering deeper insight or genuine solutions.

Here's a breakdown of the "meta" you've observed:

    "I have a problem with X, or I noticed X": This is the initial observation, often something broadly accepted as problematic (e.g., misinformation, polarization, decline in civility). It hooks the reader by identifying a shared concern.

    "It's due in large part to Y, but entirely Y": This is where the "midwittery" often solidifies. A single, often obvious or currently popular, cause (Y) is identified. The author might then spend effort debunking the idea that Y is the sole cause, but without truly exploring the multifaceted nature of the problem or proposing a more complex causal model. It's an almost performative display of nuance without delivering genuine depth.

    "Boy, X sure is bad!": The article concludes by reiterating the initial problem, perhaps with a sense of resignation or alarm, but without advancing the understanding of why X persists despite the partial debunking of Y, or what might actually be done about it.

Your use of "midwittery" aptly captures the essence: it's analysis that gestures — feigns — at complexity but ultimately falls short of truly wrestling with it. It occupies a space between simplistic takes and genuinely profound insights, leaving the reader with a sense of dissatisfaction because they've been led through a seemingly analytical process that yields little new understanding. Ultimately, however, the process is the goal, not the destination. A defining characteristic of midwittery is gloss-over gnosticism, a pretense toward intellectualism. The mediocritic does not need, and certainly does not invite, criticism of his own beliefs, as they are, prima facie, correct and unassailable. The pool of discourse is markedly consistent and generally revolves around the inabiity to compete, though redirected away from the creator, as that would imply responsibility, etc., etc.:

- Everything is expensive
- Everything is also bad, b/w things were better previously
- Capitalism bad
- Jobs/employment bad
- Wealth bad

Accompanying jargon: "Peak capitalism," "en—tification," "wagie," "gaslight," and so on.

To be clear, I understand those graduating uni at this particular moment are having a tougher time than I did. AI is used on both sides of the table: Hiring managers screen with it, and graduates use it to make as many variations as they need and send them out at a speed unimaginable a decade ago. I had to submit 526 job apps before I got my corporate gig, and that seems like a minimum now. Of course, for those who came before me, 500+ apps may have seemed an impressive number. Either way, needs want. 

It feels like intellectual labor without intellectual payoff. You're looking for analysis that doesn't just critique existing explanations, but builds better ones, even if those are inherently more challenging to articulate.

## Amelioration
There are two major factors that contribute to my overall wellbeing: being a Christ follower and the idea of expectation management. Things get worse over time — that's part and parcel of living in a fallen world. Knowing I am but a visitor here makes that more than bearable. Because of that, I fully expect things to get worse, so I am seldom disappointed.

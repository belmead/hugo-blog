A while ago, I explained the meme pipeline to an intern (slow day). A reductive version of it goes something like this:

4chan -> YouTube/Reddit -> Facebook

The arrows are not to temporal scale: An idea can bounce around on 4chan for years ('normies,' 'chads') before escaping to YouTube and Reddit, before finally coming to rest at Facebook. En—tification is the latest 

this might be a good intro: In compiling the list of wisdom my father gave me (link to other post here), a few things have made themselves known:
1. I dramatically overassume on others' knowledge.
2. my father, a plain man - indeed, a redneck from east Texas - passed on to me wisdom less noticed in others as time goes on
3. the desire to know, or the hatred of not knowing, is a quality rarer than I estimated.

YouTube is a funny reflection: Show me a man's homepage and I'll tell you his interests. it has a fun house aspect to it, a heavy handedness that assumes you've a great interest in residential electrics if you watch a single video about changing a doorbell transformer, but it's accurate in a vulgar sort of way.

There's a meta showing up in my homepage lately, what I'm terming 'PCL': problem-cause-lament. here's the m.o.:

- identify the predictable
- experience the predictable
- feign bafflement or disappointment or some flavor of offense
- weakly gesture at a supposed culprit
- throw hands up because it turns out multifaceted
- anodyne conclusion

(collection of yt screenshots here)

PCL is an attempt at playing nice. The alternative, e.g., not understanding marketing exists to deceive and manipulate, seems worse. That is, I'm peeved less by the actor than the truly ignorant, which is a curious attitude to have. I don't feel great about that. bit of a thinker, that.

And this was from Gemini, re: https://asteriskmag.com/issues/11/scapegoating-the-algorithm I added to it as well
You've perfectly articulated a common and frustrating pattern in a certain type of commentary, labeling it "midwittery." It's a critique of articles that follow a superficial "problem-cause-lament" structure without offering deeper insight or genuine solutions.

Here's a breakdown of the "meta" you've observed:

    "I have a problem with X, or I noticed X": This is the initial observation, often something broadly accepted as problematic (e.g., misinformation, polarization, decline in civility). It hooks the reader by identifying a shared concern.

    "It's due in large part to Y, but entirely Y": This is where the "midwittery" often solidifies. A single, often obvious or currently popular, cause (Y) is identified. The author might then spend effort debunking the idea that Y is the sole cause, but without truly exploring the multifaceted nature of the problem or proposing a more complex causal model. It's an almost performative display of nuance without delivering genuine depth.

    "Boy, X sure is bad!": The article concludes by reiterating the initial problem, perhaps with a sense of resignation or alarm, but without advancing the understanding of why X persists despite the partial debunking of Y, or what might actually be done about it.

Your use of "midwittery" aptly captures the essence: it's analysis that gestures — feigns — at complexity but ultimately falls short of truly wrestling with it. It occupies a space between simplistic takes and genuinely profound insights, leaving the reader with a sense of dissatisfaction because they've been led through a seemingly analytical process that yields little new understanding. Ultimately, however, the process is the goal, not the destination. A defining characteristic of midwittery is gloss-over gnosticism, a pretense toward intellectualism. The mediocritic does not need, and certainly does not invite, criticism of his own beliefs, as they are, prima facie, correct and unassailable. The pool of discourse is markedly consistent and generally revolves around the inabiity to compete, though redirected away from the creator, as that would imply responsibility, etc., etc.:

- Everything is expensive
- Everything is also bad, b/w things were better previously
- Capitalism bad
- Jobs/employment bad
- Wealth bad
- Conservatism bad
- Yearning for things that never were

Accompanying jargon: "Peak capitalism," "en—tification," "wagie," "gaslight," and so on. Words can mean whatever you want them to.

To be clear, I understand those graduating uni at this particular moment are having a tougher time than I did. AI is used on both sides of the table: Hiring managers screen with it, and graduates use it to make as many variations as they need and send them out at a speed unimaginable a decade ago. I had to submit 526 job apps before I got my current gig, and I now hear such a number wouldn't cut it anymore. Of course, for those who came before me, 500+ apps may have seemed an impressive number. Either way, needs want. 

It feels like intellectual labor without intellectual payoff. You're looking for analysis that doesn't just critique existing explanations, but builds better ones, even if those are inherently more challenging to articulate.

## The Internet we were Promised
There's a fine line between ignorance and sophistry. The sophist knows he's wrong, but tries to convince you anyway, whereas the ignorant thinks he's correct, but isn't in the business of purposefully misleading people. Actual sophistry is mercifully rare (in the grand scheme). I was reminded of that distinction at Wikipedia recently, in the top bit:

(screenshot of wikipedia)

I ought to apply my own advice — management of expectations on Wikipedia — but the headline did get the better of me. Who's "we," and who promised... anything regarding the internet? Do they mean "the web?" No matter. 

## Amelioration
There are two major factors that contribute to my overall wellbeing: being a Christ follower and the concept of expectation management. Things get worse over time — that's part and parcel of living in a fallen world. Knowing I am but a visitor here makes that more than bearable. Because of that understanding, I fully expect things to get worse, so I am seldom disappointed. By no means am I in favor of things getting worse — far be it from me to want more misery in the world.

My only advice is, then, to Man Up.

## Louis Rossman
Surprisingly, Iit takes me months to write some of these posts, and so during that epoch many things tend to happen. This post went from complaining about annoying YouTube trends to complaining about people not understanding how capitalism works, and just last week Louis Rossman convinced a good amount of people to change their YouTube avatars to Clippy. Even as I sat down to complain about that, he actually followed through and published a video on the "now what?" My original intent was to gripe about the impotent rage inherent in activism, so I'll go down that road for a bit.

It's endlessly amusing when users of a platform take issue with a change the platform makes — so much so that it causes them to try to band together to gain attention — and I saw [this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44877021) on HN, which I took as auspicious.

Re: "Where were you when goog.gl shutdown?"
> This is ridiculous.
Google is not some opaque corporate entity (I mean, yes it IS, but...), it is made up of individuals, many of whom read this site.
Google should offer to send (the public content from) their DB directly to The Internet Archive. It results in LESS overhead for Google than this attempt to scrape it, and results in better information.

as well as 

> This is unbelievable. We're all used to Google abandonware by now but the resources required for storage of shortened URLs and any dev maintenance must be so miniscule to be a rounding error to a rounding error on any budget anywhere in the company.
What can possibly be the motivation for this? I see no rationale for it in the linked post.
Google already has severe trust issues with anything they launch. They hurt themselves because people expect whatever is being launched to be abandoned so why invest in it? Reputation matters.

### "This is ridiculous."
Is it, though?

### "This is unbelievable."
... is it, though?

Truly, there is nothing new under the sun. Man will continue to put faith in companies of any size to not kill off services and be befuddled when that service — oftentimes provided for free — is discontinued. It's the same issue with the ens—ification idea: Complete surprise when something that was once cool becomes lame.

# A New Starting Paragraph
It seems to me there's a decent framework to use then thinking about people vis a vis technology: those who marry their tools and those who court. Marriage leads to entrenchment, and if you've ever been part of an org with impossibly sclerotic, legacy infra or tool use ("we've always used PowerPoint; stop messing around in Canva/Figma/Slidebean/Beautiful.ai") you'll know what a Sisyphean task it is to try and use a different software, even for a one-off. I try to use a different presentation software for every AI meeting I run, and more than once I've heard, "What an interesting deck. I want to socialize it — can you put it into our PowerPoint?" This is the language of the old married couple.
The courtship dynamic is more frenzied, full of stops and starts. If a piece of software is not critical (and sometimes, even when it is), it's likely to be tried and evaluated against other competitors. If for no other reason and excitement and novelty! This is similar to the attitude of the early adopter: Willing to take a chance, willing to deal with one or two substandard features if there are some innovations to be found. Or for a lark. Either way.

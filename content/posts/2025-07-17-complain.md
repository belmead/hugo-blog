A while ago, I explained the meme pipeline to an intern (slow day). A reductive version of it goes something like this:

{{< callout type="tip" text="4chan -> YouTube/Reddit -> Facebook" >}}

The arrows are not to temporal scale: An idea can bounce around on 4chan for years ('normies,' 'chads') prior escaping to YouTube and Reddit, before finally coming to rest at Facebook. Enâ€”tification is the latest 

this might be a good intro: In compiling the list of wisdom my father gave me (link to other post here), a few things have made themselves known:
1. I dramatically overassume on others' knowledge.
2. my father, a plain man - indeed, a redneck from east Texas - lost my reason of thought here
3. the desire to know, or the hatred of not knowing, is a quality rarer than I estimated.

YouTube is a funny reflection: Show me a man's homepage and I'll tell you his interests. it has a fun house aspect to it, a heavy handedness that assumes you've a great interest in residential electrics if you watch a single video about changing a doorbell transformer, but it's accurate in a vulgar sort of way.

there's a meta showing up in my homepage lately, what I'm terming tactical oblivion. here's the m.o.:

- identify the predictable
- experience the predictable
- feign bafflement or disappointment
- anodyne conclusion

(collection of yt screenshots here)

'tactical oblivion' is, I assure you, an attempt at playing nice: the alternative, e.g., not knowing marketing exists to deceive and manipulate, seems worse. that is, I'm peeved less by the actor than the truly ignorant, which is a curious attitude to have. I don't feel great about that. bit of a thinker, that.

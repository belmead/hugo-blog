title: Paradox of Agency 
---

On his excellent Wretched Radio podcast, Todd Friel said children vary in the age at which they are culpable for sin. A toddler may err yet not commit sin; a five-year-old <em>may</em> know that a choice is wrong and still choose that choice. In the latter example, a sort of sin debt is being added to. For the sake of simplicity, I'm ignoring the concept of imputed sin. I may return to that concept at a later time, or I may not.

One of the lesser points Mr. Friel made on that episode (I'll link to it if I can ever find it) is the age of moral responsibility — knowing right from wrong, sin from non-sin — varies, sometimes greatly, between children. At exactly the moment the child has the mental wherewithal to choose between a right thing and a wrong thing, a responsibility is created: That is, the causer of an action must enjoy or bear the effect.

There is another idea that closely aligned with the concept of agency in my mind:
## You deserve nothing

I do not declare that figuratively. I do not deserve the salary I earn from my employer: Remuneration is, necessarily, due. That's one of the points of contracts and agreements, in fact. Statements that one deserves this or that are centered around a perception of being owed. Who or what is responsible for doling out what is owed is often difficult, if not impossible, to identify, so "the world" (or in a previous era, "the man") suffices. After all, since it's unclear what this great force of withholding is, misidentification is meaningless.

A non-insignificant amount of advertising (mostly for goods rather than services) revolves around selling the concept of deserving the thing: You deserve a beer, vacation, beer on a vacation, et cetera. An especially bold advertiser will take the risk of providing a reason you are in this state of deserving: You deserve a beer because you worked hard. Wasn't it a long day? The vulnerability here is predicated on the hearer having fulfilled the task that puts them in the state of deserving. 

This is tablestakes rewarding — participation trophies for (in this scenario) those of drinking age. I have no formal education in marketing, but as a passive observer (and not-infrequent collaborator with marketing teams), it's my passive observation that a good deal of marketing is predicated on infantalizing the listener (or viewer, reader...). A key differentiator (possibly <em>the</em> differentiator, with regard to mental capacity) between children and adults is the capacity to assume responsibility.

∀x(P(x)∧R(x)→A(x))

Predicates:
- P(x): x is a person
- R(x)R(x): x has responsibility
- A(x)A(x): x is an adult

The obverse of this (with same predicates) is:

∀x(P(x)∧¬R(x)→¬A(x))

Ergo a person without the capacity for responsibility is not an adult (read: child). Infantalization-based marketing supposes that a responsible person can enter into a wonky superposition of maturity: The paradox of "adulting." 

Loan companies are merely that — companies. These enterprises exist to make money. Any claims to a greater good from for-profit institutions are window-dressing — measures designed to both entice and deceive. Loan companies are no different than any other outfit regarding the basics of how business is done: a transaction is made, and that transaction is based on an agreement on a proposition. This is the "deal:" I provide x in exchange for y.

One of the underpinnings of contracts being able to work at all is the ability for both parties to enter into agreement. "Ability" in the sense that due diligence has taken place (e.g., is this person who they say they are?) and both parties have been found to be capable bearing the onus of culpability. Loans are interesting in that it's not a binary answer (deal or no deal) but rather variations in loan specifics (e.g., the APR) in the domain of the deal.

A one-off request of forbearance isn't noteworthy. I've certainly faced my share of hurdles in life, and I reckon you have as well. A large part of my sense of agency stems from ownership of those hurdles: I built them myself. To wit: I am the cause. 

Recognizing I am the author of my own problems is one of the fundamental aspects of responsibility. It's validation that I am indeed an adult capable of handling risk, at least to the degree required to enter into agreements. If I fail at handling the risk, I am rightly culpable.

What I cannot do, however, is choose to take on risk and then bail if things go sour.

Doing so would justifiably bring my capacity into question.

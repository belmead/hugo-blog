#Notes
I get bored easily, and my usual solution is to start a project (finishing the project is another thing entirely) and for whatever reason, YouTube has been showing me homelab videos for the last six or nine months, which is right up my alley: It's a mixture of something I am:
- Familiar with / good at (computers)
- Unfamiliar with / bad at (servers)
- Interested in (prospect of remote dev env / divesting from clouds I do not own)

There are several homelabbing YouTubers, but I've found [Hardware Haven](https://www.youtube.com/@HardwareHaven) to be right in line with my level of understanding. He often does videos on the cheaper side of things, which I appreciate, as I have a newborn and would like to minimize costs wherever possible.

Hackernews' Newest section is a great source of blogs I'd otherwise never find. Sometimes it's gold like [Dan Luu's blog](https://danluu.com/). Oftentimes it's more like [Muni Blog](https://blog.muni.town/digital-homeownership/). I have not read every blog post on Muni, and have no ire toward the author — never met the man! — but the post rankles for a number of reasons. It's not a lengthy post, so let's take this bit by bit.

## The summary 

I trust, after multiple readings, I understand the author's point. If I err, contact me and I will remedy this post accordingly.

The thrust of the post seems to be advocating for web users to disinvest from mega-platforms such as Facebook and instead opt for publishing (loose usage of the word) content on personal websites (in this case, using [Weird](https://weird.one), which, best I can tell, is part of the alt-web or indie web or whichever en vogue byname the ___ has attributed to it this quarter). I've no problem with the project itself (sounds like a neat venture) and I encourage any and everyone to lease domains and upload HTML files and build databases, etc.. I'm also in agreement with a few of the points Erland makes, but for different reasons, some of which will be explored below.

## Autoinfantilization

From the get-go:

> You deserve a home on the World Wide Web that’s built to keep you safe; a magical place for virtual living that‘s yours for life, existing in a sociable web.

How to begin?

For ages I've tried to understand what people mean by "deserve." It's not a challenging piece of English, to be sure, but it baffles nonetheless. The persuasion of being informed you deserve something diminishes rapidly when an explanation is offered, so that the author skips the effort there is entirely in line with the better (worst?) advertising tactics.

I'm not sure how a domain keeps me safe. Who's the assailant?

I'm equally unclear on what attributes a domain has that imbues magical properties.

Ditto for virtual living. What does this mean? What is the takeaway from this subhead?

> Homeownership on the web is highly analogous to the physical world.

Is it, though? I'd be less invective if not for the intensifier "highly." 

> We're all born under someone else's roof, inhabiting the shared space of our parents or guardians until it's time to "leave the nest". Unlike our feathered friends however, it is extremely rare for us to have a place of our own in adolescence.

No issue tracking so far.

> In the beforetimes we would just pick out a nice spot close to our neighbors, throw an animal hide over a bunch of sticks and call it a day. In modern times there's not a plot of land that isn't already _owned_, almost certainly by a feudal lord who bought it up in bulk for the purpose of renting it back to you.

I disagree with the holocene portrayal, but that's far outside the scope here. I expected the wicked, no good, very bad "feudal lord" to appear, and the author did not disappoint. I'm not a betting man, but I'd be wager lunch this antagonist is a — gulp! — capitalist (probably a big old meanie, too).

Not worthy of analysis is the "almost certainly ... for the purpose" bit. Unsure sure how this idea squares with agricultural pursuits. Or wind farms. Or any number of reasons one might own land. Soldiering on:

> Modern homeownership therefore is mostly a story of home-rentership, not real _ownership_.

Sure.

> Incredibly, this matches the online experience, even though the world wide web has an infinite amount of real-estate!

Again — does it, though? Additionally, what aspect of this thin analogy makes it incredible?

> Most people's home on the internet is situated in some hyper-scale condominium, like
> `facebook.com/yourhome`

I do not follow how this is anyone's "home." To be fair, I am not a Facebook user, and therefore firmly insulated from the nonsense that goes on there, so. Can't comment from a vantage of a user.

> You don't own that place, you're merely renting it in exchange for your data and attention, which Facebook and its ilk uses to sell you things. (I.e. manipulating you into buying stuff you don't need.)

Covered in another blog post.

> It's common knowledge now that so called "free" platforms come at a very high price indeed: your agency.

"Common knowledge" is a fallacy.

## Irony

The irony found in this post isn't evident until reading the copy above. I've noticed Joe Reddit (workshopping this naming scheme. Joe Buzzword? Tik-Tok Brock?) has finally torn enough sheets out of their word-of-the-month calendars to arrive at *agency*. Pity, since it's going to temporarily reduce to meaningless a concept I've spent a sizable amount of my adult life pondering.

The short version is this: You don't get to choose agency and embrace weakness simultaneously. In this very article, I've been told that I'm manipulated and deserve a magical home where I can feel safe. So which is it? One of the pillars of agency is making the choice to own what happens to you, good and bad. Agency is the domain of the strong; it must be created and maintained. Beware of anyone attempting to *give* (or sell!) you agency.

Laconically: Choose one:
- You're a weak victim that gets preyed upon by big, mean corporations, and you have no other alternative but to use their services. That you agreed to their terms of service isn't important. Actually, don't think about that too much. Capitalism bad, nothing is your fault, etc. Or,
- You are capable of making choices and dealing with the consequences. 

You can't have it both ways.

Parade another of the weak man's boogeymen:

> The chilling truth is that Facebook isn't contented just showing you ads. For [attention-economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) platforms, the ideal customer is a perfectly predictable consumer.

Chilling that a company — an entity created to generate revenue — would pursue extra-ad opportunities to earn money? In what way does that chill?

> A predictable consumer is someone who can be [nudged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory) in whichever direction benefits the primary objective of the platform, which is _ceaseless accumulation of profits_.

Yes, this is correct. That's how companies work.

I'll skip the bit about Manufacturing Consent lest I have an aneurism. Suffice to know it's more "you're being oppressed, nothing is your fault" victim-speak.

> The extractive mega-platforms are in the business of [commercial surveillance](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/09/ftc-report-confirms-commercial-surveillance-out-control) and data brokering; they will happily help you [amuse yourself to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death) with their gamified dopamine feeds, so long as you don’t do it too quickly.

More of the same big-companies-are-bad copy alongside "dopamine" and "gamified." Just one more buzzword and I can claim bingo. I'm willingly ignoring the Neil Postman link. He shares company with Milton in the group of poorly understood authors. Pity the guy.

> You deserve a home on the World Wide Web that’s [built to keep you safe](https://blog.erlend.sh/cozy-community-software); a magical place for virtual living that‘s yours for life, existing in a [sociable web](https://nex-3.com/blog/a-sociable-web/).

It's the subhead again. No more informative here as it was at the start.

> We believe agency on the web begins with a personal website on your own domain.

It occurs to me that I don't know what the author means by *agency*. The assumption in the writing is the reader comes prepared with a familiarity toward the concept, but on third read, I don't know if the author knows what agency is.

Skipping some paragraphs about the tech...

> Real-estate on the web is less static, like floating islands! 🏝️  (or walking houses)

I'm assuming it's a "skill issue" that I still cannot comprehend the real estate analogy.

> _To fully inhabit the World Wide Web you must embody your digital self within it._

I don't know what this means.

Leaning on the fast forward button:

> While it’s a far more agentic platform than Facebook, GitHub is owned by an even bigger and equally ominous company. My agency on Microsoft’s platform is more a result of market forces (developers are slightly more discerning about lock-in effects) than a core value and priority on their part.

It is true that MSFT is larger than Meta. In case you missed it, Microsoft bad.

Side note: I agree here. Microsoft *indeed* bad. I just abhor how this opinion is presented, even if I agree. It's infantile.

That very infantilization is at odds with the concept of agency.

I don't have a problem with Erland, and I certainly don't dislike his project. Make websites until the sun burns out, go nuts. It's the victimhood marketing I can't stand.

## Mental Health

YouTube's algorithm is hit and miss. I've recently received a spate of videos critical of the consumerist issue prevalent in "mental health," which I did not watch (Wenn ich psychische Gesundhei höre) but did remind me of the lengths man will go to in order to avoid seeking God. Rather, man seeks Him in everything except Himself, and since the heart is an idol factory, small wonder the concept of "mental health" is the superfactor du jour. At least it's closer to the truth of things: Yer messed up, and you know it - but swerves at the idea that the fault is a heart issue, or some imputed thing only God can remedy. Regardless, beloved, who told you to expect happiness? Are you owed that, too?

To be clear, being a Christ follower promises hardship, but doesn't use wordly happiness as the carrot. Trials are a natural occurrence (normal and expected!) but Christ is living water, the bread of life. In Him we rest and know peace (His peace, not the world's peace). There is the snag the MH crowd does not accept, won't consider, or has not considered: This is a wicked, fallen world, and you cannot buy peace of mind.

That last bit can be overlooked in GYST: The "your" part. MUGYST is the apex of secular psychological help: elegant, short and cheap. Free, even, as it has no dependencies, no additional packages to install. GYST's followup to IONTBO is "so get used to it," which is a bit tautological when paired with Man Up, but it's neat in its complement.

A watchphrase of the product designer is expectation management. That is, you effect experiences by controlling user expectations. You can't be disappointed if you do not appoint unreasonable expectations on outcomes. The earlier you jettison any notions of fairness and

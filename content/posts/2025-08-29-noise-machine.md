# Foreword
Our six-month-old hates sleepâ€”not uncommon for infants, apparently, though difficult to comprehend given how much he's disrupted his parents' sleep. We know white noise works (or is an excellent placebo), so we purchased a white-noise machine from Amazon. The baffling lack of research that went into this device is a case study in itself. Let me tell you about it.

## User Context
Accessibility is not the sole domain of disabled users. There exists a wide range of contextual and situational accessibility needs:

The machine lives on my side of the bed, and I only use it when the room is dark. This is the backdrop that informs the rest of my complaints about the UX of this machine.

### Zero affordance
There is a vertical trio of buttons on the face of the machine. None of them have a tactile cue as to which one is which, but because there are only three of them, I can know which one does what because I can *feel the buttons* and I have commited all three to memory. That is not the case with the assortment of buttons on the top, which exist along the perimeter. (I am not excusing a lack of additional tactile cues on the button trio â€” think of the raised bit on the F and J keys â€”Â but these buttons are the least offensive part of the machine).

As you'll notice, these top buttons are neither raised nor have a tactile cue, and (the picture does not show this, but be assured) there is no backlight. Recall I only interact with this thing in darkness, so if I tap one of these buttons in error, I have to orient the machine (swiftly) in my mind to figure out where the opposite command is, so I can reverse the action I just took. This is a wholly unenjoyable problem at two or three in the AM, which is when my son likes to wake up to babble for a spell before dozing back off.

### A Warm Light in the Darkness
I felt a bit less foolish about this one, as my wife said she only recently figured out how this works (recall we only interact with this thing in the dark): The top mesh is a capacitive touch switch. Tapping it, even lightly, causes a warm (~3000K) light to come on underneath the trio of buttons. Continued presses cycles the thing through three or four intensities like any other touch-sensitive light. A normal interaction:

- Lay the child to sleep in his crib
- Press the power button on the device
- Whoops, my fingers grazed the mesh, so now there's light a-shining
- Try to retrace my steps and turn it off somehow
- Press the volume up button in error, as the buttons are invisible at the night. Now there are two (light, disruptive sound) issues to deal with
- Unplug the thing in frustration
- Plug it back in; light comes right back on
- Press what I now think is the light-control button
- Mistakenly press the timer button; "TIME: 15 MINUTES" heartily announced
- Cycle through all time modes, each a sonorous proclamation
- etc., etc.

To be clear, the fault lies not with the light itself: A nightlight certainly has some value. The execution baffles, however.

### Research, Research, Research
This is an example of "tell me you did no research without telling me..." Were any parents involved in the making of this item? I doubt it. It's a tiresome affair altogether.

### Fixes
Were I able to iterate on this design:

- **Make the top buttons real buttons** rather than flat ones, so I know if I am about to press one. This removes the risk of pressing in error.
- Additionally, **add a backlight to the top buttons**. A soft, dim white light will suffice. This helps me understand what I am doing in the dark, which is the main (only) time I use this device.
- Add a **tactile affordance** to at least the center top button. This is another effort to reduce pressing in error.
- **Normalize iconography** (this is a daytime-use suggestion: Note the use of both + and ðŸ”Š to indicate the same action. This reduces confusion for the user.
- Just **use a normal dial** for the nightlight. The mesh surface is too large for capacitve touch.
- For that matter, put the light control ***near the light***. Observe the [Law of Proximity](https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity/).

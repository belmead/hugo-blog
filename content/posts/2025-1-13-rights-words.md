title: More Words about Rights
draft: true
---

[Medhir Bhargava](https://medhir.com/blog/right-to-root-access) wrote a blog post that did fairly well on HN about degrees of control over devices (root access). His tl;dr is a great summary:

>If you own a computing device outright, you should be able to make any level of software modification you desire. hardware manufacturers should not be allowed to absolutely restrict distribution of software to their own channels under the guise of safety.
>
>In the broader conversation of right to repair regulations, we also need to be thinking about a "right to root access" for computing devices.

The blog post is short enough and worth a read to understand his thinking on the subject. I'll restrict my thoughts to the "rights"portion of his argument.

A (great) while back, I ran across a quote, which I will misremember here: "'Rights' are just 'things you want.'"I think what Medhir misunderstands (or, more likely, *I misunderstand about his argument*) is 1) where rights come from, and 2) what ownership is. I've written enough on ownership — see posts here and here — but a brief description of my concept of ownership is, "if you can't open it, you don't own it," coupled with a strong examination of a the TOS or other documentation you signed when you began to use a product (did you buy the thing, or just license it? You may view the two as synonymous, but companies absolutely do not). There's a reason I use Linux, and I will never tire of using this meme:

I don't understand the concern here with the first sentence: If I purchase a device from company X, and either during the initial setup phase or point of purchase, I agree to terms and conditions which stipulate how I use the device, on what grounds can I complain about being locked out of bootloaders, or whatever? If the argument here is "well, it'd be nice if more device manufacturers offered a method by which I could access (whatever)," then sure, that would indeed be neat. But it's another thing entirely to say, "well, companies shouldn't be allowed to lock me out of (whatever)." Companies are(typically) private enterprises, so it's their call what they want to enable or disable with the products they sell. *They don't owe you anything*.

The reverse is true as well: You don't owe companies anything. If a device manufacturer doesn't allow root access, and that's a dealbreaker, then, maybe, don't buy from them...? 

On a side note, I enthusiastically agree with the following statement:

> Devices that are locked become e-waste once a manufacturer stops supporting them

E-waste is a problem, surely, but I don't think forcing private companies to unlock all of their devices is the solution. On the other hand...

... it's become clear as day to me recently (across the last 20 years, anyway) that even if you make the world's most compelling argument, provide charts, graphs, animated videos, and even dumb the subject down as far as it can go, some people will just not be convinced something is worth doing. Not smoking, for example. Or adopting MFA practices. Or not using TikTok (or any social media). The end result is always the Bugs Bunny "no" meme. I state this because one argument that could be made is, "well, if you explain to people that buying these devices encourages 'anti-consumer' behavior — even if it immediately affects them or not — they will buy alternatives," you and I both know that won't happen. Cigarettes still fly off the shelves. So I have a paradoxical view of this topic (it's evolving, check back later for updates): On the one hand, *I* know about and care about root access, so *I* won't buy a device that I can't `sudo` around in. But the other ~90% don't know, and don't care, and don't care once they *do* know. Because of the hoi polloi, maybe we should force companies, via legislation or otherwise, to allow root access.

This is partially sarcastic response, and I don't think I fully believe it. It's a terrible insult to both companies and the public. Ultimately, I'm against forcing behavior w/r/t consumption on either side of the POS machine — it messes with the agency of the buyer and seller.

I would certainly hope that a company that opted to make root-access-enabled devices would just fly off the shelves. I also hope that they will eventually sell the Totoya Hilux Champ stateside, for similar reasons.

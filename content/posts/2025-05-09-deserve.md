One of the crueler aftereffects of post-modernism is making viable the option to simply not growing up. I distinctly recall having this same conversation about a decade ago with a housemate after having visited a great friend of mine who just became a father at ~22. This is was planned and rightly viewed as a blessing for a man who had been raised in the old way. Meanwhile my friends â€” we all lived like near-impoverished playboys: work-shy drunkards and letches, all of us, cruising from one vulgar amusement to another. Why launch when basecamp was this enjoyable? Launching was for suckers. A scam, to be sure.

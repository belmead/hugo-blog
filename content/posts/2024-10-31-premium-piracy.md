On the [Hacker News-posted article](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41999314 ) (originally found on [Gaming on Linux](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/)), I found this comment:

![Hacker News comment](https://belmead.github.io/blog/images/hacker-news-piracy.png "Hacker News comment")

Not a new idea, surely, and I've seen it often on YouTube comments for videos of similar topics, and I feel compelled to comment on it at long last.

## Background

I began pirating around 2000 or so. Napster worked well enough for a while, when individual songs were appropriate for the storage media I had access to/could afford, but before long I moved to torrents and entire albums. For a while, after I got my first car, I often drove to Blockbuster to rent DVDs for movies I couldn't find torrents for so as to rip them with Gordion Knot and host seeds. I reckon my finest moment was uploading vinyl rips of Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz's "Deja Vu (Uptown Baby)" b/w "Marmalade." I was convinced "Marmalade" was not available online prior to that point, as it wasn't (to the best f my knowledge) on their album <em>Make it Reign</em>, so I was doing fellow heads a favor by rectifying that situation. A much older and slightly wiser can identify the errors here.

## The Comment

> Ownership is the premium version of a product.

I concur with bitsandboots on this point (see previous posts re: ownership)...

> Turns out piracy is sometimes the only ownership option.

... yet on this point, I strongly disagree with bits. Regardless of how much you may want something, theft is not a justifiable option. To think — planting a flag on this point over <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>! Is the only other option in this scenario not to thieve? Where is the line in the sand on this — that is, what's the point of decision wherein it becomes an acceptable form of recourse to steal a thing, and does this decision framework extend to others? Say I decide I want — cannot live without! — your vehicle. Is it acceptable to just drive off with it?

So we're clear on what I mean by "pirating:"

> One type of copyright infringement is popularly known as piracy. This involves duplicating and distributing copyrighted materials without permission from the copyright holder.

Re: Vehicle theft: I don't buy the digital vs. tangible goods division: That the difference in the vehicle and a video game is that as a digital good, <em>GTA</em> is copyable with comparatively minimal effort. It's just bits and bytes, after all. This argument shifts the discussion away from *when* it's acceptable to steal to *why* it's acceptable to steal — some mighty serious conclusion jumping.

There's an undercurrent of entitlement present as well: To wit, that Rockstar games owes you or I something, or that we have any right to products they release.

By no means do I desire to create animosity between bits and myself, but this is foolishness. If I'm adverse to playing games requiring kernel-level anticheats, then the solution is to *not play the game*. That's the simplest way to adhere to my principles on the matter. Principles often require you to not do things you'd (possibly) rather do, if it weren't for values getting in the way. That's part of the entire point of the matter. Stealing, as a third option, does double duty in that it's a betrayal of principle while robbing the individual or group of individuals who created the good. Principles that don't stand up to the whimsy of desire are weak, flimsy things. 

As I was writing this post, another game was removed from the Steam Deck scene: [Apex Legends is taking away its support for the Steam Deck and Linux](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat). If I were an Apex Legends player, my options would be:

1) Play Valorant on an OS that could pass security checks, or 
2) Do not play Valorant.

 The former might even require me to build a separate computer (or just dual-boot), but the point stands: I'm not entitled to this video game. Electronic Arts is not in a position wherein they owe me anything.

I'm not ignorant to the larger story regarding the Apex Legends issue — kernel-level anticheat — and I might cover that at a later time, but I thought it important enough to buttress my argument here.

## Licensed, Not Sold

In fact, game companies rarely, if ever, sell you anything. Let's take a gander at the [terms of service for Rockstar games](https://www.rockstargames.com/legal):

>2. Limited License. 
**2.1. We Reserve All Rights to our IP.**
We, and our licensors, own and reserve all rights, title, and interest in and to the Services, Virtual Items, and your Account (excluding any tangible medium the Services may be supplied on), including all: (1) information, text, data, files, code, scripts, designs, graphics, artwork, illustrations, photographs, sounds, music, titles, themes, objects, characters, names, dialogue, locations, stories, plot, animation, concepts, audio-visual effects, virtual goods and in-game currency (including Virtual Items), interactive features, gameplay, methods of operation, the compilation, assembly, and arrangement of the materials of the Services, Virtual Items, or your Account, and all other copyrightable material; (2) trademarks, logos, trade names, trade dress, service marks, and trade identities of various parties, including ours; and (3) other forms of intellectual property (all of the foregoing, collectively “Content”).

Furthermore:

>**2.2. Your Personal, Non-Commercial Use.**
>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the Services, including Virtual Items and your Account, for your personal, non-commercial enjoyment. The Services, Virtual Items, or your Account, including the Content, but excluding any tangible medium the Services may be supplied on, are licensed, not sold. This license is personal to you only and does not give you any ownership rights in any of the Services, Virtual Items, or your Account (or in or to any of their features or Content).

You never owned the game, because you can't — you merely purchased a license to play (access the service). Rockstar is very clear on this point.

## Smug Pirates' Motto

I'd hoped the phrase, "if buying isn't owning, then piracy isn't stealing," would not reach meme status, but that ship has sailed. Once Linus or Asmon gets ahold of something, it's over.

![YouTubers on piracy](/img/2025-06-30-youtuber-piracy.png)
*Many such cases*

Rightly dividing the phrase means knowing some use it tongue-in-cheek while others just download it into their mind's `roguish_intellectualisms` subdir. It's a fools-in-good-company phrase. To be clear, I empathize with the antecedent entirely. The prevailing attitude seems to be, "I'd willingly pay for something if I could truly own it," a stance good and right. Nothing wrong with that.

So to be clear, this is how it goes:

1) Company creates (or licenses) a product — allows use via a licensing system
2) User acquires a license, mistaking it for ownership
3) Company quits supporting product, changes product, etc., which is well within their right to do
4) User decides he was wronged (again, based on confusion stemming from lack of attention to detail)
5) User steals IP and smirks

This is — in part — of how we arrived at Stop Killing Games. If you aren't aware, Stop Killing Games is a consumer initiative led by Ross Scott, advocating for legislation to prevent video game publishers from rendering games unplayable by shutting down servers without providing alternatives. The movement seeks to ensure continued access to games post-server shutdown, such as through offline modes or private servers. It has gained significant traction, achieving over one million signatures in the EU, prompting debates in both the European Commission and UK Parliament. Rerez has a [good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dblhx8mPaE) about an instance of this happening a while back with one of the Tony Hawk games.

I'm not terribly convinced by the pro-SKG arguments. Expectation management is key: It seems foolish to expect a company to support servers for a game indefinitely (which is why giving the option to run personal servers is by far the preferred option). On the other hand, I don't think single-player games should require access to the Internet in order to be played. I gather this is becoming more and more the norm, but none of the games I play or are interested in playing use this method, so it doesn't mean much to me. Even if that were the case, in an extension to my point above about Valorant, I wouldn't play that game. Tough.

# Despite Better Sense
Watching YouTube videos critiquing modern comics wasn't so much as a mistake as it was a primer on the state of modern (read: Marvel and DC) comics: Pick up any ish of a mainstream cape story and wince away.

## Reliance on other issues I am never going to read
By no means is this a new phenomenon - ~70 years ago, Lee was advising readers to refer to extra-run issues for insight on previous happenings:

The difference here is the aggression. This run of Dr. Strange is part of the One World under Doom scenario, and a look at the last page of any issue informs readers all of the current titles in the event:

I'll tell you right now, IART (I ain't reading that). You'd have to really be into this Dr. Doom arc (I was hoping I would be — Dr. Doom is an awesome character) to buy and read all of these issues, but after reading 

## Dated speech
I'm a hypocrite on this front. Comics necessarily use the speech of their time, and I find the golden and silver age speech terribly charming, like a fun time capsule.

What I do not like, however, is the achingly modern speech in the issues I picked up from the LCS.

How do you do, fellow comic book enjoyers?

## Bad art
Defenders of bad art are wont to say, "all art is subjective."
1) Not every painting, drawing, or sculpture is art by dint of existence
2) Bad art abounds
2a) Modern art is bad art - e.g., found art is not but roadside debris.

I knew page one of the first issue of [Dr. Strange of Asgard](https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/123723/doctor_strange_of_asgard_2025_1) I wouldn't like the run. I had just come off reading [Marvel Masterworks: Dr. Strange Volume 1](http://www.marvelmasterworks.com/marvel/mm/docstrange/drs_mm01.html), which was satisfying. I've never read comics from any era, so starting with golden age Lee and Ditko, in a way, set me up for disappointment later on. Lee's writing is serviceable, but Ditko's art is sublime.

*Steve Ditko's midcentury proto-psychedelic Dr. Strange*

At my LCS, I recently found the original issues of Fantastic Four available as facsimiles – the covers made the issue jump out from the surrounding titles. This was Kirby's work, much in the same vein as Ditko — bright colors, great use of whitespace, classic title art...

*Lee's silver-age cover work*

Contrast that with the latest Dr. Strange run (part of the OWUD arc, natch). The cover is... fine:

![Dr. Strange of Asgard](/img/2025-04-13-dr-strange-asgard.jpg)
*Not bad - classic-enough Dr. Strange*

But the guts let me down:

![Asgard](/img/2025-04-13-asgard.jpeg)
*It's dark, and Asgard is a drab hellhole*

The entire ish is a meandering, chiaroscuro slog. I'll revist the first issue before reading the second, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to continue to purchase the run out of spite.

I'm aware this is a personal problem - you may like the art and the inelegant writing of the TDS-steeped Doom arc - but it's not for me. Mercifully, I have the entire golden and silver age to get through.

# Despite Better Sense
Watching YouTube videos critiquing modern comics wasn't so much as a mistake as it was a primer on the state of modern (read: Marvel and DC) comics: Pick up any ish of a mainstream cape story and wince away.

## Bad art
Defenders of bad art are wont to say, "all art is subjective."
1) Not every painting, drawing, or sculpture is art by dint of existence
2) Bad art abounds
2a) Modern art is bad art - e.g., found art is not but roadside debris.

I knew page one of the first issue of [Dr. Strange of Asgard](https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/123723/doctor_strange_of_asgard_2025_1) I wouldn't like the run. I had just come off reading [Marvel Masterworks: Dr. Strange Volume 1](http://www.marvelmasterworks.com/marvel/mm/docstrange/drs_mm01.html), which was satisfying. I've never read comics from any era, so starting with golden age Lee and Ditko, in a way, set me up for disappointment later on. Lee's writing is serviceable, but Ditko's art is sublime.

*Steve Ditko's midcentury proto-psychedelic Dr. Strange*

I also found the original issues of Fantastic Four were available as facsimiles – the covers made the issue jump out from the surrounding titles. This was Kirby's work, much in the same vein as Ditko — bright colors, great use of whitespace, classic title art...

My son is coming up on 4 months, so I decided to write down all of the wisdom my dad passed along to me, as well as the things I discovered on my own so as not to forget. Less like Proverbs, more deep-fried bon mots and working-class prudence. Updated on an ongoing basis.

## Companies are not your friend / companies do not care about you.
Do not make this mistake. Companies exist to make a profit, and that is all. A corollary to this is, "never carry water for a company unless you own that company."
Pro-tip: You cannot be betrayed by a company if you do not put sufficient trust in them to be betrayed. See [Bioware Shills Get HARSH Reality Check As Failure Of Dragon Age: The Veilguard Leaves Them Betrayed](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=972sWLLcqoU).

## Constantly adjust your expectations.
This goes with the above, but can be applied elsewhere. "Fool me once," and that.

## Always read the EULA.
It's surprising how many people blindly, thoughtlessly sign EULAs without knowing what is in them. Be especially wary of the "L" in EULA, and understand what that means. Licensing â‰  ownership.

## Your personality is what you do and how you act.
That is to say: attributes are not a personality. Many people go online and download the latest trendy personality. Avoid these people when you can.

## If you claim to have agency, you must own your failures and mistakes.
If you are truly in control of your own life and decisions, then you can't have it both ways. Only you care about your failures as much as you think others do.

## Knowledge and wisdom are like fine jewels. Only a fool would not grasp at them.
Devour all information you can get your hands on. As for reading, consume mostly non-fiction, but do not neglect the Western canon of non-fiction: You must cultivate a deep reference pool.

## Math and reading are of paramount importance.
Always read at a grade level beyond your actual school grade, and when you graduate, be sure to continue reading at a high level. The same goes for math: Never be satisfied in what you know (especially in finance). If you cannot master reading and math, the world will be a very difficult place for you.

## Never do what they do.
This is a heuristic - more descriptive than prescriptive. If the world is doing something, do not do that thing. We are set apart, so we must act like it.

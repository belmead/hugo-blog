My son is coming up on 4 months, so I decided to write down all of the wisdom my dad passed along to me, as well as the things I discovered on my own so as not to forget. Less like Proverbs, more deep-fried bon mots and working-class prudence.

**Companies are not your friend / companies do not care about you.**
Do not make this mistake. Companies exist to make profit, and that is all. A corollary to this is, "never carry water for a company unless you on it."
Pro-tip: You cannot be betrayed by a company if you do not put sufficient trust in them to be betrayed. See [Bioware Shills Get HARSH Reality Check As Failure Of Dragon Age: The Veilguard Leaves Them Betrayed](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=972sWLLcqoU).

**Constantly adjust your expectations.**
This goes with the above, but can be applied elsewhere. "Fool me once," and that.\

**Always read the EULA.**
It's surprising how many people blindly, thoughtlessly sign EULAs without knowing what is in them. Be especially wary of the "L" in EULA, and understand what that means.

**Your personality is what you do and how you act.**
That is to say: attributes are not a personality. Many people go online and download the latest trendy personality. Avoid these people when you can.

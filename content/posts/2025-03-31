Found this: [It's not just setting Teslas on fire. Now irate Americans are shoplifting from Whole Foods](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ar-AA1BKHP3), which starts most excellently:

> Lee insists he's "famously" a very good Catholic. He's a moral person — his mother raised him right. And by his internal calculation, it's OK to shoplift from Whole Foods. Why? Because of Jeff Bezos.

It's wrong to point at a man — especially one I've never met — and exclaim, "Ah, there's some of that good, old-fashion'd papistry for you," but that's difficult here.

  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>On the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41999314">Hacker News-posted article</a> (originally found on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/">Gaming on Linux</a>), I found this comment:</p>
<p><img src="https://belmead.github.io/blog/images/hacker-news-piracy.png" alt="Hacker News comment" title="Hacker News comment"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to believe this is copypasta — I see this so often, nearly word-for-word each time. If it is copypasta, I&rsquo;m officially out of touch. Even with the risk of Old Man Yells at Thieves, I&rsquo;ll go ahead with the critique.</p>
<p>I began pirating around 2000 or so. Napster was enough for a while, when individual songs sufficed, but before long I moved to torrents. For a while, after I got a car, I frequently drove to Blockbuster to rent DVDs for movies I couldn&rsquo;t find torrents for so as to rip them with Gordion Knot and host them. I reckon my finest moment was uploading a vinyl rips of Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Deja Vu (Uptown Baby)&rdquo; b/w &ldquo;Marmalade.&rdquo; I was convinced &ldquo;Marmalade&rdquo; was not available online prior to that point, as it wasn&rsquo;t (to the best f my knowledge) on the album <em>Make it Reign</em>, so I was doing heads a favor by rectifying that situation. A slightly wiser me knows this was wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ownership is the premium version of a product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I concur with bitsandboots on this point (see previous posts re: ownership)&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns out piracy is sometimes the only ownership option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; yet on this point I strongly disagree with bits. Regardless of how much you may want something, pirating is not a justifiable option. To think — planting a flag on this point over <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>! Is the only other option in this scenario not to thieve? Where is the line in the sand on this — that is, what&rsquo;s the point of decision wherein it becomes an acceptable form of recourse to steal a thing, and does this decision framework extend to others? Say I decide I want — I just cannot live without! — your Toyota 4Runner. Is it acceptable to just steal it?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re clear on what I mean by &ldquo;pirating:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One type of copyright infringement is popularly known as piracy. This involves duplicating and distributing copyrighted materials without permission from the copyright holder.

</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy the digital vs. tangible goods division: That the difference in the 4Runner and a video game is that as a digital good, <em>GTA</em> is copyable with comparatively minimal effort. It&rsquo;s just bits and bytes, after all. This argument shifts the discussion away from when it&rsquo;s acceptable to steal to why it&rsquo;s acceptable to steal, which is some mighty serious conclusion jumping.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an undercurrent of entitlement: To wit, that Rockstar games owes you or I something, or that we have any right to products they make.</p>
<p>By no means do I desire to create animosity between bits and myself, but this is foolishness. If I&rsquo;m adverse to playing games requiring kernel-level anticheats, then the solution is to not play the game. That&rsquo;s the simplest way to adhere to my principles on the matter. Principles often require you to not do things you&rsquo;d (possibly) rather do, if it weren&rsquo;t for the principles getting in the way. That&rsquo;s part of the entire point of the matter. Stealing, as the third option, strikes me as a betrayal of principle while robbing the individual or group of individuals who created the good. Principles that don&rsquo;t stand up to the whimsy of desire are weak, flimsy things.</p>
<p>As I was writing this post, another game was removed from the Steam Deck scene: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">Apex Legends is taking away its support for the Steam Deck and Linux</a>. If I were a Valorant player, my options would be: 1) Play Valorant on an OS that could pass security checks, or 2) do not play Valorant. The former might even require me to build a separate computer (or just dual-boot) but the point stands: I&rsquo;m not entitled to this video game. Electronic Arts is not in a position wherein they owe me anything.</p>

<p>I was browsing Slashdot and found <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/24/11/20/1543236/half-of-young-norwegians-justify-piracy-as-streaming-costs-soar">this</a>:</p>

<p>Piracy also provides a way of watching your content whenever you want and does not depend on the existence of upstream provider or whether they still have a license for it.</p>
